    <h2>1. Conditional Field Validation</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented validation for the “Other Skills” section. When the checkbox is selected, users must enter text in the field, ensuring the form is complete and informative.

    <h2>2. Display Confirmation Email Simulation</h2>
    <p>
    I included a simulation of email confirmation, so users receive a confirmation message on-screen with their email after submitting an application.

    <h2>3.  Login Lockout Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
    To enhance security, I implemented a lockout timer that prevents login attempts for 5 minutes after 3 failures, reducing the risk of brute-force attacks
